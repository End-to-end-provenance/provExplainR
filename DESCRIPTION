Title: Compare two provenance collections to explain different script outputs
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2019-06-02
Author: Khanh Ngo
Maintainer: Khanh Ngo <ngo22k@mtholyoke.edu>
Description: 
    Inspects provenances collected by the 'rdt' or 'rdtLite' packages, 
    or other tools providing compatible PROV JSON output created by 
    the execution of a script, and find differences between two provenance 
    collections. Factors under examination included the hardware and 
    software used to execute the script, versions of attached libraries, 
    use of global variables, modified inputs and outputs, and changes 
    in main and sourced scripts. Based on detected changes, provExplainR 
    can be used to study how these factors affect the behavior of 
    the script and generate a promising diagnosis of the causes of different 
    script results. More information about the RDataTracker family of 
    provenance tools can be found at <https://github.com/End-to-end-provenance/>.
